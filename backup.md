# MCUSec Labrary Introduction
The MCUSec laboratory is established by [Prof. Guan](https://guanle.org/) of the University of Georgia,
which focuses on the research of the vulnerabilites discovery and the security defensive solutions on the Microcontrollor platform.

The key participants are:
- **Wenqiang Li** (from March 2019 to the present), Ph.D. student at the Institute of Information Engineering, CAS, and a visiting scholar at the University of Georgia (from March 2019 to March 2020)
- **Jiameng Shi** (from August 2019 to the present), Ph.D. student at the University of Georgia

The key collaborators are:
- [Jingqing Lin](https://lin-jingqiang.github.io/), Professor at the University of Science and Technology of China
- [Fengjun Li](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~fli/index.html), Professor at the University of Kansas
